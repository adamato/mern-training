>>> MERN Project2 - React/Redux - Step By Step <<<
/* Solution Setup*/

Prerequisites:
- you must have node.js( v6 or greater ) loaded on your PC in order to run the solution
- you should have the chrome browser loaded on your PC

To get the solution running you need to:
- create a directory for the solution (i.e. C:\LabWork\MERNProject2-sbs-solution)
- unzip the contents of solution zip file into the project directory you just created. Use a solution zip from the "stage-soltions" directory. State 7 is the fully completed application.
- open a command prompt and navigate to the project directory 
- execute: npm install (this will take approx. 5 min to run)
- follow the section below on "setting up the database" 
- follow the section below "start and test server" 
- open the app in chrome: http://localhost:3000 

/* SETTING UP THE DATABASE */
The mongodb software should be available in the C:\Software\mongodb directory

Open a command prompt
navigate to: C:\Software\mongodb\bin
execute: mongod --rest

Open a Second command prompt:
navigate to: C:\Software\mongodb\bin
execute: mongo
    This will start the mongo cmd line shell
    For cmd help in the shell execute: help
    To quit the shell execute: exit 

From within the mongo shell run these commands:
    use biblio_db
    execute: db.books.save({ "isbn": "123", "title":"Dune","price":18.01 })
    execute: db.books.save({ "isbn": "456", "title":"The Stranger on the Train","price":4.49 })
	
Use this command to check that the data was inserted:
    execute: db.books.find()
	
Leave the mongod and mongo cmd line shell running

/* Start and Test the REST Server //	
Start the REST server
	Open a command prompt.
	Navigate to the project's root directory:
	execute: npm run restapi

Test the REST server:
	Open the Chrome browser
	Try the following URL
		http://localhost:4000/books
		Opening this URL submits a GET request to the REST server
		You should see the two records you added to the db earlier
		
	Try the following URL
		http://localhost:4000/books/123
		Opening this URL submits a GET request to the REST server
		You should see the one record that matches the isbn number at the end of the URL

/* Start the React application server and test */
Start the server
	Open a command prompt.
	Navigate to the project's root directory:
	execute: npm run start

Test the server
	Open the Chrome browser
	Open the following URL
		http://localhost:3000/
		You should see a page with the title "React Book List App"
		The page should also display sections for "Book List" and "Book Form"
		
Test the application		
    Try modifying a book
    Try adding a few new books
