/* mern-project1-step-by-step solution setup v2.0 */

Prerequisites:
- you must have node.js loaded on your PC in order to run the solution
- you should have the chrome browser loaded on your PC
- If you are taking the full course some of the setup listed below may already be done.

To get the solution running you need to:
- create a directory for the solution (i.e. C:\LabWork\mernproject1-solution)
- unzip the contents of mernproject1-sbs-solution.zip into the dir you created
- open a command prompt and navigate to the same dir
- execute: npm install (this will take approx. 5 min to run)
- follow the section below on "setting up the database" 
- follow the section below "start and test server" 
- open the app in chrome: http://localhost:3000 

// SETTING UP THE DATABASE //
The mongodb software should be available in the C:\Software\mongodb directory

Open a command prompt
navigate to: C:\Software\mongodb\bin
execute: mongod --rest

Open a Second command prompt:
navigate to: C:\Software\mongodb\bin
execute: mongo
    This will start the mongo cmd line shell
    For cmd help in the shell execute: help
    To quit the shell execute: exit 

From within the mongo shell run these commands:
    use biblio_db
    execute: db.books.save({ "isbn": "123", "title":"Dune","price":18.01 })
    execute: db.books.save({ "isbn": "456", "title":"The Stranger on the Train","price":4.49 })
	
Use this command to check that the data was inserted:
    execute: db.books.find()
	
Leave the mongod and mongo cmd line shell running

// START AND TEST SERVER //	
Start up the REST server
    Open a command prompt.
    Navigate to the project dir
    execute: npm run server

Try the REST server:
    Open the Chrome browser
    Try the following URL
        http://localhost:3000/books
        Opening this URL submits a GET request to the REST server
        You should see the two records you added to the db earlier
        
    Try the following URL
        http://localhost:3000/books/123
        Opening this URL submits a GET request to the REST server
        You should see the one record that matches the isbn number at the end of the URL

Try the application:
    Open the Chrome browser
    Open the following URL
        http://localhost:3000/
        You should see a page with the title "React Book List App"
        The page should also display sections for "Book List" and "Book Form"
